/*<h2>atmosphere/definitions.glsl</h2>

<p>This GLSL file defines the physical types and constants which are used in the
main <a href="functions.glsl.html">functions</a> of our atmosphere model, in
such a way that they can be compiled by a GLSL compiler (a
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file
provides the same types and constants in C++, to allow the same functions to be
compiled by a C++ compiler - see the <a href="../index.html">Introduction</a>).

<h3>Physical quantities</h3>

<p>The physical quantities we need for our atmosphere model are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometry">radiometric</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(optics)">photometric</a>
quantities. In GLSL we can't define custom numeric types to enforce the
homogeneity of expressions at compile time, so we define all the physical
quantities as <code>float</code>, with preprocessor macros (there is no
<code>typedef</code> in GLSL).

<p>We start with six base quantities: length, wavelength, angle, solid angle,
power and luminous power (wavelength is also a length, but we distinguish the
two for increased clarity).
*/

#include "../uniform_layout.sh"

#define Length float
#define Wavelength float
#define Angle float
#define SolidAngle float
#define Power float
#define LuminousPower float

/*
<p>From this we "derive" the irradiance, radiance, spectral irradiance,
spectral radiance, luminance, etc, as well pure numbers, area, volume, etc (the
actual derivation is done in the <a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++
equivalent</a> of this file).

#define Luminance float
#define Illuminance float

/*
<p>We  also need vectors of physical quantities, mostly to represent functions
depending on the wavelength. In this case the vector elements correspond to
values of a function at some predefined wavelengths. Again, in GLSL we can't
define custom vector types to enforce the homogeneity of expressions at compile
time, so we define these vector types as <code>vec3</code>, with preprocessor
macros. The full definitions are given in the
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file).

<p>Finally, we also need precomputed textures containing physical quantities in
each texel. Since we can't define custom sampler types to enforce the
homogeneity of expressions at compile time in GLSL, we define these texture
types as <code>sampler2D</code> and <code>sampler3D</code>, with preprocessor
macros. The full definitions are given in the
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file).
